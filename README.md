Data Analytics Internship - Codveda 🚀

This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my Data Analytics internship at Codveda. The project focuses on the end-to-end analysis of a customer churn dataset, moving from raw data preparation to advanced predictive modeling.

📁 Projects & Tasks

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Level 1)
The first phase of the project involved preparing the Churn dataset for analysis.
Action: Handled missing values, treated inconsistent data entries, and removed non-predictive features.
Result: A clean, standardized dataset ready for exploratory analysis and machine learning.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA (Level 1)
In this task, I performed a deep dive into the data to identify key trends and relationships.

Visualization:
Used heatmaps and scatter plots to validate that higher usage during the day is a primary indicator of a customer's likelihood to leave.

3. Predictive Modeling (Level 3, Task 1)
The final task involved building and optimizing machine learning models to predict churn.
Models Tested: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Optimization: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to find the most efficient model settings.

Outcome: The Random Forest model was the top performer, achieving a high 94% accuracy and significantly outperforming the Logistic Regression baseline in both precision and recall.
